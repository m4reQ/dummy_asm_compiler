bits numeration:
most significant bit - 0

instruction structure:
op [arg, ...]

operation structure:
size: 1 byte
0b00000000
bits:
0 - 2 => args count
2 => is using indirect addressing (if 1 it interprets last argument as address of value rather than value itself)
3 - 8 => opcode

preprocessor directive structure:
keyword [arg, ...]

preprocessor keywords:
db [value, ...]: define bytes
dw [value, ...]: define words
resb [count]: reserve given amount of bytes
resw [count]: reserve given amount of words
const [name type value]: define constant

types:
byte - 8 bits
word - 16 bits

address size: word

reserved address values:
0x0 -> accumulator
0x2 -> base register
0x4 -> count register
0x6 -> data register
0x8 -> stack pointer
0xa -> stack base pointer
0xc -> flags register
0xe - 0x40e -> stack (1 kb)
note that these values doesn't mean actual memory locations (except the stack)
but are used to index internal processor registers

base program address: 0x40f (just after end of stack)

address wildcard keyword: $
expands to the address of used instruction
example:
0x00 jmp $     is the same as
0x00 jmp 0x00

value at address keyword: [address]
expands to the value found at given address
example:
0x00 "h"
0x01 mov eax, [0x00]   is the same as
0x00 "h"
0x01 mov eax, "h"

label structure:
.[label_name]
expands to address of instruction found right after the label

argument structure:
[type, value]

value structure:
0b00...
bits:
0 => is value or address (1 if value) (corelated with value at address keyword)
1 => argument type (0 for byte, 1 for word)
2 - n => value

if value is address it cannot be typed, means it can't be prefixed
with byte or word keyword (because we only support word size addresses)
example:
0x00 jmp .Location      ;valid
0x02 jmp byte .Location ;invalid
0x04 jmp word .Location ;technically valid but will throw an error during compilation

comment structure:
;[comment]

register size: word (except of flags register)
note: flags register cannot be accessed directly
it can be done only via pushf

registers literals:
ax - acummulator
bx - base register
cx - count register
dx - data register
sp - stack pointer register
bp - stack base pointer register

x replacements:
l - register's lower byte
h - register's higher byte

flags register structure:
0b00000000 (byte)
bits:
0 => zero flag (set if operation result is 0)
1 => sign flag (set if operation result is negative)
2 => parity flag (set if operation result is a multiple of 2)
3 => carry flag (set if addition result overflows register or subtraction result is negative)
4 => interruption flag (set if interrupts are enabled)
5 => overflow flag (set if operation overflows register)
6 => stack overflow flag (set if push* operation causes stack overflow)
7 => stack underflow flag (set if pop* operation causes stack underflow)
